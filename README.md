## Assets Bridge

This was originally intended to be a pay for use app to get me some extra funding to start a career into UE but due to limitations on how UE Marketplace deals with dependencies within the build code I couldn't get it through their systems.  So everyone wins... and now I'm making it open source to ensure the usability for everyone.

## Usage
In your project directory create or change directory into (Plugins) then clone this repository into there, it should look like this:
```YourUnrealProject/Plugins/AssetsBridge```

Then once completed go into the editor and enable the assets bridge plugin, restart and the window will pop up asking you to set up the base configuration (or just click the settings icon that is now net new on the editor)
